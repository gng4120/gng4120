            <p>

              Details The Ottawa Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada will be hosting free public stargazing in the parking
              lot of the Carp branch of the Ottawa Public Library (beside the Diefenbunker Museum). Our members will set
              up their telescopes and share their passion of the night sky by inviting the public to have a look and enjoy
              the night's sky. "Star parties" are wonderful family-friendly events and well-suited for people who wish to
              know more about the night sky. You do not need to bring a telescope to attend. But if you have one, and wish
              to bring it feel free to do so. If you require any assistance setting up your telescope, arrive a little early
              and someone will gladly help. Please note that the stargazing will only occur if there are clear skies. If
              the sky is cloudy, we will cancel the event. We have scheduled a series of back up dates. Sometimes due to
              unpredictable weather, we are forced to cancel a star party with only a few hours notice. Before making your
              way to the star party, please check here for a "Go" or "No-Go" message. The back up dates for this star party
              is Saturday June 9, Friday June 15, and Saturday June 16. If we need to reschedule a star party due to cloudy
              skies, we will update this meetup.
